                <h3>My road</h3>
                <p>I'm master mathematician with 3+ years of data science/software engineering experience. Iâ€™m passionate about finding solutions for challenging problems. Working with data and analytics allows us to make informed decisions and to stop guessing.
                    I love clean code, and elegant design solutions, and I thrive in dynamic work environments.</p>

                <h3>Enjoying drinking coffee</h3>
                <p>What I like to do the most is to enjoy myself while drinking coffee. I love all types of coffee but homemade coffee is my favorite. Did you know how they come with idea of making it? Legend has it that 9th-century goat herders noticed
                    the effect caffeine had on their goats, who appeared to "dance" after eating the fruit of the Coffea plant. A local monk then made a drink with the produce and found that it kept him awake at night, thus the original cup of coffee
                    was born.</p>
